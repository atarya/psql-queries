Find the upward recommendation chain for member ID 27: that is, the member who recommended them, and the member who recommended that member, and so on. Return member ID, first name, and surname. Order by descending member id.
  
      with recursive recommenders(recommender) as (
          select recommendedby from cd.members where memid = 27
          union all

        order by memid desc          
        
        
Find the downward recommendation chain for member ID 1: that is, the members they recommended, the members those members recommended, and so on. Return member ID and name, and order by ascending member id.
      
      with recursive recommendeds(memid) as (
            select memid from cd.members where recommendedby = 1
            union all

              from recommendeds recs
              inner join cd.members mems

            from recommendeds recs

Produce a CTE that can return the upward recommendation chain for any member. You should be able to select recommender from recommenders where member=x. Demonstrate it by getting the chains for members 12 and 22. Results table should have member and recommender, ordered by member ascending, recommender descending.
      
      with recursive recommenders(recommender, member) as (
              select recommendedby, memid
                from cd.members
              union all
              select mems.recommendedby, recs.member
                from recommenders recs
                inner join cd.members mems
                  on mems.memid = recs.recommender
            )
            select recs.member member, recs.recommender, mems.firstname, mems.surname
              from recommenders recs
              inner join cd.members mems		
                on recs.recommender = mems.memid
              where recs.member = 22 or recs.member = 12
            order by recs.member asc, recs.recommender desc
